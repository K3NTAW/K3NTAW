### ðŸ‘¤ About me 
Greetings, my name is Kenta and I am an aspiring developer with a multicultural background; my lineage is half Japanese and half Swiss, and I currently reside in Switzerland. I have a passion for language acquisition and relish the opportunity to create entertaining and practical projects with them. Presently, I am focused on acquiring fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and JavaScript programming languages. Additionally, I have been exploring Docker, a tool used for software containerization, to improve my workflow and deployment processes.
